# Guide for Working with the Repository

## Quick Note before beginning

* Below are instruction for working with Git repositories from the command line. For those who would rather use a GUI for pull/push/merge, there are plent options available - see below for an abbreviated list.  The process will work the same, but for executing each step, check the GUI client's documentation for help.
  * [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
  * [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
  * [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) - windows only.
  * [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
  * See [here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows) for a more complete list.
